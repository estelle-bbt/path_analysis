# Sound project

The aim of this project is to better estimate mating success and understand how  
its estimation influences conclusions about sexual selection, using the model  
species *Brassica rapa* and its main pollinator *Bombus terrestris*.

We have two main objectives:  
+ Explore which estimates of pollinator visits are the best predictors of observational  
  mating success  
+ Compare the results of Bateman gradients and variance decomposition,  
  using observational versus genetic mating success
